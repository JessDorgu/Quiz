# Quiz

This project is meant to use my working knowledge of JavaScript to create a timed multiple choice quiz. The timer will begin to run once the start button is clicked. If the incorrect answer is selected time will be deducted from the amount of time left. 

Users will be able to log their high score on a seperate html page.
